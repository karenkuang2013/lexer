Introduction
This document is a guide to explain how developers handle and design the lexer. This java
project contains several packages. In project 2, we only need to revise the lexer package and the
setup package.

Lexer will first read the content of a file character by character from the command line. After
running lexer project, Lexer will print out the results to indicate the types of token which Lexer
have read from file. In order to trace the errors and clarify the tokens, Lexer needs to print out
the line number, left position and right position of the token.

For further documentation, plese read the project 2 documentation in the repo.
